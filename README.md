# TELECOM-CUSTOMER-CHURN-ANALYSIS

## 🌟Excited to Share My Latest Project: Telecom Customer Churn Analysis! 🚀

I built a comprehensive Telecom Customer Churn Analysis solution using SQL Server, Power BI, and Machine Learning. This project combines data insights, ETL processes, visualization, and predictive modeling to support targeted strategies for customer retention.

### 📊 Project Highlights:
This end-to-end project demonstrates my skills across the full data pipeline, from ETL to prediction:

Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL) in SQL Server
Data Cleaning and Transformations in Power BI
Power BI Visualizations to bring insights to life
Machine Learning model for churn prediction using Random Forest
Dashboard integrating both historical and predicted churn data

### 📝 Key Insights:
Total Customers: 6,418
Churn Rate: 27% (1,732 projected churners) with 411 new joiners

### Demographic Insights:
Female customers account for 64.15% of churn (1,111) vs. male at 35.85% (621).
Age Group >50 has the highest churn at 31%, while <20 age group churns at 23%.

### Account Insights:
Payment Methods: Mailed Check shows the highest churn rate at 38%, followed by Bank Withdrawal (34%) and Credit Card (15%).
Contracts: Month-to-Month has a high churn rate of 47%, compared to One-Year (11%) and Two-Year (3%) contracts.
Tenure: Customers with >=24 months have a churn rate of 28%, representing 32.52% of total customers.

### Geographic Insights:
Highest Churn Rate: Jammu & Kashmir at 57%, compared to Delhi's 30%.

### Service Insights:
Fiber Optic has the highest churn rate at 41%, while other types like DSL and None remain lower (8%).
Over 90% churn is associated with Internet and phone services, particularly with unlimited data plans.

### 🔍 Predictive Model:
Using Random Forest, I developed a predictive model with 85% accuracy to forecast future churners, enabling proactive customer retention strategies.

## 🚀 Business Outcome:
Created a dynamic Power BI dashboard that highlights churn metrics, identifies high-risk groups, and empowers data-driven marketing decisions.
Potential impact: estimated 5% reduction in churn, leading to significant revenue protection.
This project gave me the chance to dive deep into customer behavior and understand the patterns behind churn. It’s a rewarding journey to see data transform into actionable insights!
